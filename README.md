# No Ally Attack Collision

Tired of allies taking the hit of your attacks resulting in no damage to anything? Well then this mod is made for you, hypothetical person!

Also includes config for enabling the collision ignoring for enemy attacks aswell (they won't ever hit each other).

Feedback? Found a bug? Just want a place to yell at me? Please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Goorakh/NoAllyAttackBlock/issues/new).
